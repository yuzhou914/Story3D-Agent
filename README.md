### Visualization of Story3D-Agent
**Story3D-Agent** is an innovative LLM-agents system designed for 3D storytelling visualization. The primary objective of the LLM-agents system is to adeptly transform a provided narrative into a corresponding 3D visualization. Below we illustrate the narrative titled *Race Day*, represented as a 3D-rendered representation.
